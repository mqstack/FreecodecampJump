						<h3>Here are examples:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Screening Quiz (Epic Story)</strong> As the HR manager, I want to create a screening quiz so that I can understand
								whether I want to send possible recruits to the functional manager.[9]
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Quiz Recall</strong> As a manager, I want to browse my existing quizzes so I can recall what I have in place
								and figure out if I can just reuse or update an existing quiz for the position I need now.[9]
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Limited Backup</strong> As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled
								up with things I don't need saved.[10]
							</li>
						</ul>
